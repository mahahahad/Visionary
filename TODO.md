# TODO

Start with an intro section.

- There once was a man
- wanted to conquer the world
- but didn't know where to start
- this man knew a lot of shit
- you could say he was
- **VISIONARY**

Logo and all will be made later. (I'm thinking the cliche man standing on cliff)

Something like that, the text isn't set in stone. Except the last part.

Fades out and gameplay starts.

No tutorial must be provided to have the user learn things themselves and have fun.

## Mechanics

Are people that fix your cars lmao.

Fr though. At the start, the user is provided with some backstory on their current location followed by 3 options for business ideas. Ideally, they should pick the business that is best for their current location to make the most profit and speedrun. However, if they choose to go with the other options, it'll just take longer to make money. (Good idea to have a timer as well to see how long it took to build your empire or something.)

Once the user has enough money, they can start thinking about expanding their business since the demand for their product is very high and they have no way of meeting those requirements with just one factory.

At one point, the city has more residents than it can handle. This is where the real twist comes in.

If you thought this was just another business game. You are wrong. You are now a city planner and must adequately start planning how you're going to accommodate all these residents. While also running your businesses.

And then whatever.
